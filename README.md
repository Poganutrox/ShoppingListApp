# Grocery Sync

Grocery Sync is a dynamic shopping list application developed for Android. This project combines a Kotlin-based frontend with a [Spring Boot backend in Java](https://github.com/Poganutrox/SupermarketApp), enabling users to keep track of real-time prices from various supermarkets. The key features include creating shopping lists, comparing prices, and sharing lists with others.


## Introduction

Economic difficulties necessitate careful spending, particularly on routine expenses like grocery shopping. Comparing supermarket prices manually is cumbersome, often deterring users from optimizing their spending. Grocery Sync addresses this issue by providing a convenient mobile app to compare real-time supermarket prices and manage shopping lists efficiently.


### Application Requirements

- Internet connectivity for real-time price updates and synchronization.
- User authentication and data security.
- Efficient data retrieval from supermarket APIs.
- User-friendly interface for list management and price comparison.

### Objectives

- Retrieve and compare products from Mercadona, Consum, Alcampo, and Dia.
- Filter products by name, supermarket, category, price, and promotional offers.
- Track price evolution and recommend purchases based on price trends.
- Enable users to favorite products, create, modify, delete, and share shopping lists.

## Results

The application successfully integrates with supermarket APIs, providing real-time price comparisons and enabling efficient list management. Users can share lists, track price changes, and make informed purchasing decisions.
